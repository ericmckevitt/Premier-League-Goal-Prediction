2. Python is used in Jupyter Notebook files
3. eda.ipynb was used to preprocess the data and perform feature engineering. prediction.ipynb is where the models were created, evaluated, and iterated upon. 
4. You can run prediction.ipynb without having run eda.ipynb, because the results of eda.ipynb were saved to the processed.csv file. You can run either notebook file depending on what you are interested in seeing.
